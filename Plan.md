Goal: Create A Basic Todo App

Features: 
1. Once you write a todo and hit create, a box with your todo will appear.
2. You will have controls to delete or see the todos you finished.

Plan: 
1. Create variables that connect to the elements created in the html.
2. Create a function that receives the users todo and saves it in a div called 'box' we will create.
3. Create another function that adds that box to the section view.
4. Finally create all event listeners for the functions to run.
